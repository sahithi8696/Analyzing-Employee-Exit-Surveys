# Analyzing-Employee-Exit-Surveys

In this project, we are going to work with exit surveys from employees of the DETE (Department of Education, Training and EMployment) and TAFE(Technical and Further Education) institutes of Australia.

In this project, we will clean the data and analyse it to answer the following questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

We carryout the following steps to clean and analyze the data:

- Explored the data and figured out how to prepare it for analysis
- Corrected some of the missing values
- Dropped any data not needed for our analysis
- Renamed the columns
- Check the data for any logical inconsistencies
- Created a new institute_service column
- Cleaned the Contributing Factors columns
- Created a new column indicating if an employee resigned because they were dissatisfied in some way
- Combined the data
- Cleaned the institute_service column
- Handled the missing values in the dissatisfied column
- Aggregated the data and plotted it
